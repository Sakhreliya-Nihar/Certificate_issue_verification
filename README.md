# Student-Certificate-Management-System (SCMS)

## **INTRODUCTION**

The introduction section serves as a foundation for understanding the Student Certificate Management System (SCMS) and its underlying goals and technologies. This section will provide an overview of the project, its objectives, the technologies employed in both front-end and back-end development, as well as the purpose and significance of the system.

### **2.1 Project Overview**
The Student Certificate Management System (SCMS) is a robust web application meticulously developed to streamline the process of recognizing and showcasing student achievements and certificates within a classroom setting. This application serves as a centralized platform for administrators, teachers, and students to interact and share educational milestones in a user-friendly and organized manner.

**Key Features:**
-	**Role-based Access Control:** The system incorporates distinct user roles, including admin, teacher, and student, each with tailored privileges and responsibilities, ensuring efficient management.
-	**Enhanced Interactivity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** By leveraging the power of fundamental web technologies, SCMS ensures a dynamic and interactive user experience.
-	**Responsive Design for All Devices:** The application is developed with a responsive design approach, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to ensure an appealing layout across various devices and screen sizes.

### **2.2 Objective**
The primary objective of SCMS is to create a centralized platform for showcasing student certifications. This system aims to:
-	Streamline the process of recording and accessing student accomplishments for teachers and administrators.
-	Enhance communication and transparency among teachers, students, and administrators.

### **2.3 Technologies Used - Front end and Back end Technologies**
SCMS leverages a selected set of front-end and back-end technologies for optimal performance and user experience:

#### **Front-end Technologies:**
-	**HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript:** These fundamental web technologies form the backbone of the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
-	**Bootstrap:** This front-end framework streamlines design, enhancing the application's responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
#### **Back-end Technologies:**
-	**PHP (XAMPP):** PHP, in conjunction with the XAMPP stack, serves as the server-side environment, facilitating the handling of server-side tasks and ensuring high performance.
- **MySQL:** As a relational database management system, MySQL efficiently stores and manages student records, and user information.
